Q2 Data Cleaning: 1) Merge the cost schedule for different parking systems into the cars_per_parking_sys.csv dataset. 2) After merging, create a column indicating the price paid by vehicles for each parking system at the time they switch to a zero-cost fare, based on the provided information about the timing of the switch.

Q3 Data Exploration: Analyze how the transition to free parking impacts parking activity.

Q4 Estimation: Estimate the effect of parking cost on the number of parked vehicles.

Q5 Big Data Processing: Assuming your computer can only handle 200K rows of data in RAM at once, the database containing data from parking systems psres_33, psres_34, psres_35, and psres_36 is corrupted. The raw data dump is available in raw_park_sys_info_df.csv. Note that this data dump represents the unprocessed data used to generate the data found in cars_per_parking_sys.csv.
