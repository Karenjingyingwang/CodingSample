Q2 Data Cleaning: 1) merge the cost schedule for different parking systems into the cars_per_parking_sys.csv dataset;2)After merging, based on the information about the time at which different neighborhood parking systems switch to a zero-cost fare, create a column indicating the price paid by vehicles for that parking system at that time

Q3 Data Exploration: understand how the switch to free parking affects parking activity

Q4 Estimation: estimate the impact of parking cost on the number of vehicles parked

Q5 Big Data Processing: Please assume for the below questions that your computer can handle only 200K rows of data in RAM at once. The database containing data from parking systems psres_33, psres_34, psres_35 and psres_36 was unfortunately corrupt! The data dump is available in raw_park_sys_info_df.csv. Note that this data dump is the raw data used to produce the data seen in cars_per_parking_sys.csv
Here is the complete coding sample folder including the coding file and the datasets mentioned above:
