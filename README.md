Q2 Data Cleaning: 1) Merge the cost schedule for different parking systems into the cars_per_parking_sys.csv dataset. 2) After merging, create a column indicating the price paid by vehicles for each parking system at the time they switch to a zero-cost fare, based on the provided information about the timing of the switch.

Q3 Data Exploration: Analyze how the transition to free parking impacts parking activity.

Q4 Estimation: Estimate the effect of parking cost on the number of parked vehicles.

Q5 Big Data Processing: Assuming the computer can only handle 200K rows of data in RAM at once, the database containing data from parking systems psres_33, psres_34, psres_35, and psres_36 is corrupted. The raw data dump is available in raw_park_sys_info_df.csv. Note that this data dump represents the unprocessed data used to generate the data found in cars_per_parking_sys.csv. 
- Based on patterns in the number of cars parked for these 4 parking systems, identify which of the parking systems, if any, have errors in data logging. (Note: the one-off missing values handled in the data cleaning step shouldn’t be a concern here)
- One possible reason for problematic patterns seen in the erroneous parking systems could be due to mislogging of vehicles
  - When vehicles fail to get registered in a timestamp but the system handles the error gracefully, you will see a “-99” in the “vehicle_ids” columns for that timestamp in the raw data. “num_vehicles” for this parking system- timestamp combination in cars_per_parking_sys.csv is then handled as a missing value. Such cases are not considered very problematic.
  - More problematic are cases when vehicles get registered in the wrong timestamp.
  - In such cases, the timestamp where vehicles failed to get registered will have the string “LogError” in the “vehicle_ids” column.
  - These vehicles then get registered in a subsequent timestamp. Vehicles that are misregistered like this will be registered with a vehicle ID that’s shorter than 16 characters in length.
  - To correct these cases, please replace the “LogErrors” with “-99”, remove cases where vehicle IDs are shorter than 16 characters in length, and regenerate the equivalent of cars_per_parking_sys.csv for the parking system(s) that have this issue.
  - To output the summary statistics of this corrected dataset, and recreate the trend figures you created to diagnose the issue in 5.1.
